# LeetCode Problems Done In Rust

All LeetCode problems are done in Rust. They should compile on LeetCode unless they change the edition and even then most of these shouldn't be affected by a Rust edition change. Each source file is named starting with the LeetCode problem number and its title description separated by dots. Some maybe incomplete due to me not completing it or figuring it out and a comment will be added stating work in progress. After all Rust is not an easy language in my opinion for solving competitive programming problems but nonetheless like any general purpose or turing complete language its possible. Just pray for no linked list problems üòÅ

## Scripts For Formatting

They are two scripts one in powershell in case of a Windows or Linux system that has powershell core. Or bash script that does functionally the same thing but for Linux and Unix like systems. Like always make sure to read the script before executing some random script off the internet. Seriously it may not be malicious but there maybe bugs. Never run something without understanding the risks.

## Notes On Compiling

The source files containing each leetcode solution cannot be run standalone and must be pasted in Leetcode or in the main.rs which is considered the scratch space.
